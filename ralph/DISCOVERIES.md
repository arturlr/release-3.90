## 2026-04-09 — Scaffold Iteration

### ATXDocumentation Gaps
- `ATXDocumentation/architecture/components.md` referenced in README but does not exist
- `ATXDocumentation/architecture/patterns.md` referenced in README but does not exist
- `ATXDocumentation/migration/component-order.md` referenced in README but does not exist
- `ATXDocumentation/technical-debt/remediation-plan.md` referenced in README but does not exist
- `ATXDocumentation/technical-debt/outdated-components.md` referenced but does not exist
- `ATXDocumentation/technical-debt/maintenance-burden.md` referenced but does not exist
- Available ATXDocumentation: 39 files across architecture (2), behavior (4), reference (3), analysis (4), migration (2), specialized (3), technical-debt (2), diagrams (4), plus README and project-overview and technical-debt-report

### Codebase Facts
- All 31 projects target .NET Framework 4.5.1 (old-style MSBuild ToolsVersion 12.0)
- 1731 C# files, ~252K LOC total
- 207 domain entity files in `Nop.Core/Domain/` across 26 subdirectories
- 117 service interfaces in `Nop.Services/`
- 27 public controllers (excluding BasePublicController)
- 54 admin controllers (excluding BaseAdminController)
- 20 plugin projects
- 5 test projects

### God Classes (>1000 LOC)
- FedEx SOAP Reference.cs: 16721 LOC (generated, will be replaced by REST API)
- CodeFirstInstallationService.cs: 12269 LOC (seed data — split into domain-specific seeders)
- Admin ProductController: 4857 LOC
- FedEx TrackService.cs: 4850 LOC (generated SOAP)
- Admin OrderController: 4379 LOC
- OrderProcessingService: 3167 LOC
- UPS SOAP Reference.cs: 2787 LOC (generated, will be replaced)
- Admin CustomerController: 2396 LOC
- Admin SettingController: 2339 LOC
- ProductService: 2142 LOC
- WorkflowMessageService: 1920 LOC

### Pattern Decisions
- Replace Autofac with built-in DI (Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection)
- Replace Newtonsoft.Json with System.Text.Json
- Replace custom ICacheManager with IMemoryCache + IDistributedCache
- Replace Forms Authentication with ASP.NET Core Cookie Authentication
- Replace SOAP web references (FedEx, UPS) with REST API clients
- Replace SQL CE support with SQL Server only
- Keep IRepository<T> pattern, implement with EF Core
- Keep domain event pattern (EntityInserted/Updated/Deleted)
- Keep model factory pattern for view model construction
- Keep GenericAttribute extension property system

### Cross-Cutting Findings
- No GDPR service directory exists in legacy — GDPR features may be spread across CustomerService
- No dedicated observability — only ILogger (DB) and KeepAliveTask
- Authentication is custom FormsAuthenticationService, not ASP.NET Identity
- Plugin system uses shadow copying and dynamic assembly loading
- Kendo UI used extensively in admin grids — needs replacement evaluation
